  # == Net::LDAP
  #
  # This library provides a pure-Ruby implementation of the
  # LDAP client protocol, per RFC-2251.
  # It can be used to access any server which implements the
  # LDAP protocol.
  #
  # Net::LDAP is intended to provide full LDAP functionality
  # while hiding the more arcane aspects
  # the LDAP protocol itself, and thus presenting as Ruby-like
  # a programming interface as possible.
  #
  # == Quick-start for the Impatient
  # === Quick Example of a user-authentication against an LDAP directory:
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  #  ldap = Net::LDAP.new
  #  ldap.host = your_server_ip_address
  #  ldap.port = 389
  #  ldap.auth "joe_user", "opensesame"
  #  if ldap.bind
  #    # authentication succeeded
  #  else
  #    # authentication failed
  #  end
  #
  #
  # === Quick Example of a search against an LDAP directory:
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  #  ldap = Net::LDAP.new :host => server_ip_address,
  #       :port => 389,
  #       :auth => {
  #             :method => :simple,
  #             :username => "cn=manager,dc=example,dc=com",
  #             :password => "opensesame"
  #       }
  #
  #  filter = Net::LDAP::Filter.eq( "cn", "George*" )
  #  treebase = "dc=example,dc=com"
  #
  #  ldap.search( :base => treebase, :filter => filter ) do |entry|
  #    puts "DN: #{entry.dn}"
  #    entry.each do |attribute, values|
  #      puts "   #{attribute}:"
  #      values.each do |value|
  #        puts "      --->#{value}"
  #      end
  #    end
  #  end

  # == A Brief Introduction to LDAP
  #
  # We're going to provide a quick, informal introduction to LDAP
  # terminology and
  # typical operations. If you're comfortable with this material, skip
  # ahead to "How to use Net::LDAP." If you want a more rigorous treatment
  # of this material, we recommend you start with the various IETF and ITU
  # standards that relate to LDAP.
  #
  # === Entities
  # LDAP is an Internet-standard protocol used to access directory servers.
  # The basic search unit is the <i>entity,</i> which corresponds to
  # a person or other domain-specific object.
  # A directory service which supports the LDAP protocol typically
  # stores information about a number of entities.
  #
  # === Principals
  # LDAP servers are typically used to access information about people,
  # but also very often about such items as printers, computers, and other
  # resources. To reflect this, LDAP uses the term <i>entity,</i> or less
  # commonly, <i>user,</i> to denote its basic data-storage unit.
  #
  #
  # === Distinguished Names
  # In LDAP's view of the world,
  # an entity is uniquely identified by a globally-unique text string
  # called a <i>Distinguished Name,</i> originally defined in the X.400
  # standards from which LDAP is ultimately derived.
  # Much like a DNS hostname, a DN is a "flattened" text representation
  # of a string of tree nodes. Also like DNS (and unlike Java package
  # names), a DN expresses a chain of tree-nodes written from left to right
  # in order from the most-resolved node to the most-general one.
  #
  # If you know the DN of a person or other entity, then you can query
  # an LDAP-enabled directory for information (attributes) about the entity.
  # Alternatively, you can query the directory for a list of DNs matching
  # a set of criteria that you supply.
  #
  # === Attributes
  #
  # In the LDAP view of the world, a DN uniquely identifies an entity.
  # Information about the entity is stored as a set of <i>Attributes.</i>
  # An attribute is a text string which is associated with zero or more
  # values. Most LDAP-enabled directories store a well-standardized
  # range of attributes, and constrain their values according to standard
  # rules.
  #
  # A good example of an attribute is <tt>sn,</tt> which stands for "Surname."
  # This attribute is generally used to store a person's surname, or last name.
  # Most directories enforce the standard convention that
  # an entity's <tt>sn</tt> attribute have <i>exactly one</i> value. In LDAP
  # jargon, that means that <tt>sn</tt> must be <i>present</i> and
  # <i>single-valued.</i>
  #
  # Another attribute is <tt>mail,</tt> which is used to store email addresses.
  # (No, there is no attribute called "email," perhaps because X.400 terminology
  # predates the invention of the term <i>email.</i>) <tt>mail</tt> differs
  # from <tt>sn</tt> in that most directories permit any number of values for the
  # <tt>mail</tt> attribute, including zero.
  #
  #
  # === Tree-Base
  # We said above that X.400 Distinguished Names are <i>globally unique.</i>
  # In a manner reminiscent of DNS, LDAP supposes that each directory server
  # contains authoritative attribute data for a set of DNs corresponding
  # to a specific sub-tree of the (notional) global directory tree.
  # This subtree is generally configured into a directory server when it is
  # created. It matters for this discussion because most servers will not
  # allow you to query them unless you specify a correct tree-base.
  #
  # Let's say you work for the engineering department of Big Company, Inc.,
  # whose internet domain is bigcompany.com. You may find that your departmental
  # directory is stored in a server with a defined tree-base of
  #  ou=engineering,dc=bigcompany,dc=com
  # You will need to supply this string as the <i>tree-base</i> when querying this
  # directory. (Ou is a very old X.400 term meaning "organizational unit."
  # Dc is a more recent term meaning "domain component.")
  #
  # === LDAP Versions
  # (stub, discuss v2 and v3)
  #
  # === LDAP Operations
  # The essential operations are: #bind, #search, #add, #modify, #delete, and #rename.
  # ==== Bind
  # #bind supplies a user's authentication credentials to a server, which in turn verifies
  # or rejects them. There is a range of possibilities for credentials, but most directories
  # support a simple username and password authentication.
  #
  # Taken by itself, #bind can be used to authenticate a user against information
  # stored in a directory, for example to permit or deny access to some other resource.
  # In terms of the other LDAP operations, most directories require a successful #bind to
  # be performed before the other operations will be permitted. Some servers permit certain
  # operations to be performed with an "anonymous" binding, meaning that no credentials are
  # presented by the user. (We're glossing over a lot of platform-specific detail here.)
  #
  # ==== Search
  # Calling #search against the directory involves specifying a treebase, a set of <i>search filters,</i>
  # and a list of attribute values.
  # The filters specify ranges of possible values for particular attributes. Multiple
  # filters can be joined together with AND, OR, and NOT operators.
  # A server will respond to a #search by returning a list of matching DNs together with a
  # set of attribute values for each entity, depending on what attributes the search requested.
  #
  # ==== Add
  # #add specifies a new DN and an initial set of attribute values. If the operation
  # succeeds, a new entity with the corresponding DN and attributes is added to the directory.
  #
  # ==== Modify
  # #modify specifies an entity DN, and a list of attribute operations. #modify is used to change
  # the attribute values stored in the directory for a particular entity.
  # #modify may add or delete attributes (which are lists of values) or it change attributes by
  # adding to or deleting from their values.
  # Net::LDAP provides three easier methods to modify an entry's attribute values:
  # #add_attribute, #replace_attribute, and #delete_attribute.
  #
  # ==== Delete
  # #delete specifies an entity DN. If it succeeds, the entity and all its attributes
  # is removed from the directory.
  #
  # ==== Rename (or Modify RDN)
  # #rename (or #modify_rdn) is an operation added to version 3 of the LDAP protocol. It responds to
  # the often-arising need to change the DN of an entity without discarding its attribute values.
  # In earlier LDAP versions, the only way to do this was to delete the whole entity and add it
  # again with a different DN.
  #
  # #rename works by taking an "old" DN (the one to change) and a "new RDN," which is the left-most
  # part of the DN string. If successful, #rename changes the entity DN so that its left-most
  # node corresponds to the new RDN given in the request. (RDN, or "relative distinguished name,"
  # denotes a single tree-node as expressed in a DN, which is a chain of tree nodes.)
  #
  # == How to use Net::LDAP
  #
  # To access Net::LDAP functionality in your Ruby programs, start by requiring
  # the library:
  #
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  # If you installed the Gem version of Net::LDAP, and depending on your version of
  # Ruby and rubygems, you _may_ also need to require rubygems explicitly:
  #
  #  require 'rubygems'
  #  require 'net/ldap'
  #
  # Most operations with Net::LDAP start by instantiating a Net::LDAP object.
  # The constructor for this object takes arguments specifying the network location
  # (address and port) of the LDAP server, and also the binding (authentication)
  # credentials, typically a username and password.
  # Given an object of class Net:LDAP, you can then perform LDAP operations by calling
  # instance methods on the object. These are documented with usage examples below.
  #
  # The Net::LDAP library is designed to be very disciplined about how it makes network
  # connections to servers. This is different from many of the standard native-code
  # libraries that are provided on most platforms, which share bloodlines with the
  # original Netscape/Michigan LDAP client implementations. These libraries sought to
  # insulate user code from the workings of the network. This is a good idea of course,
  # but the practical effect has been confusing and many difficult bugs have been caused
  # by the opacity of the native libraries, and their variable behavior across platforms.
  #
  # In general, Net::LDAP instance methods which invoke server operations make a connection
  # to the server when the method is called. They execute the operation (typically binding first)
  # and then disconnect from the server. The exception is Net::LDAP#open, which makes a connection
  # to the server and then keeps it open while it executes a user-supplied block. Net::LDAP#open
  # closes the connection on completion of the block.

    # * :host => the LDAP server's IP-address (default 127.0.0.1)
    # * :port => the LDAP server's TCP port (default 389)

    #   The password parameter may be a Proc that returns a String.

There is a fairly large range of potential values that may be given for this parameter. See #encryption for details.

    # Convenience method to specify encryption characteristics for connections
    # to LDAP servers. Called implicitly by #new and #open, but may also be called
    # by user code if desired.
    # The single argument is generally a Hash (but see below for convenience alternatives).
    # This implementation is currently a stub, supporting only a few encryption
    # alternatives. As additional capabilities are added, more configuration values
    # will be added here.
    #
    # Currently, the only supported argument is {:method => :simple_tls}.
    # (Equivalently, you may pass the symbol :simple_tls all by itself, without
    # enclosing it in a Hash.)
    #
    # The :simple_tls encryption method encrypts <i>all</i> communications with the LDAP
    # server.
    # It completely establishes SSL/TLS encryption with the LDAP server
    # before any LDAP-protocol data is exchanged.
    # There is no plaintext negotiation and no special encryption-request controls
    # are sent to the server.
    # <i>The :simple_tls option is the simplest, easiest way to encrypt communications
    # between Net::LDAP and LDAP servers.</i>
    # It's intended for cases where you have an implicit level of trust in the authenticity
    # of the LDAP server. No validation of the LDAP server's SSL certificate is
    # performed. This means that :simple_tls will not produce errors if the LDAP
    # server's encryption certificate is not signed by a well-known Certification
    # Authority.
    # If you get communications or protocol errors when using this option, check
    # with your LDAP server administrator. Pay particular attention to the TCP port
    # you are connecting to. It's impossible for an LDAP server to support plaintext
    # LDAP communications and <i>simple TLS</i> connections on the same port.
    # The standard TCP port for unencrypted LDAP connections is 389, but the standard
    # port for simple-TLS encrypted connections is 636. Be sure you are using the
    # correct port.

    # This is a re-implementation of search that replaces the
    # original one (now renamed searchx and possibly destined to go away).
    # The difference is that we return a dataset (or nil) from the
    # call, and pass _each entry_ as it is received from the server
    # to the caller-supplied block. This will probably make things
    # far faster as we can do useful work during the network latency
    # of the search. The downside is that we have no access to the
    # whole set while processing the blocks, so we can't do stuff
    # like sort the DNs until after the call completes.
    # It's also possible that this interacts badly with server timeouts.
    # We'll have to ensure that something reasonable happens if
    # the caller has processed half a result set when we throw a timeout
    # error.
    # Another important difference is that we return a result set from
    # this method rather than a T/F indication.
    # Since this can be very heavy-weight, we define an argument flag
    # that the caller can set to suppress the return of a result set,
    # if he's planning to process every entry as it comes from the server.
    #
    # REINTERPRETED the result set, 04May06. Originally this was a hash
    # of entries keyed by DNs. But let's get away from making users
    # handle DNs. Change it to a plain array. Eventually we may
    # want to return a Dataset object that delegates to an internal
    # array, so we can provide sort methods and what-not.

    # #bind connects to an LDAP server and requests authentication
    # based on the <tt>:auth</tt> parameter passed to #open or #new.
    # It takes no parameters.
    #
    # User code does not need to call #bind directly. It will be called
    # implicitly by the library whenever you invoke an LDAP operation,
    # such as #search or #add.
    #
    # It is useful, however, to call #bind in your own code when the
    # only operation you intend to perform against the directory is
    # to validate a login credential. #bind returns true or false
    # to indicate whether the binding was successful. Reasons for
    # failure include malformed or unrecognized usernames and
    # incorrect passwords. Use #get_operation_result to find out
    # what happened in case of failure.
    #
    # Here's a typical example using #bind to authenticate a
    # credential which was (perhaps) solicited from the user of a
    # web site:
    #
    #  require 'net/ldap'
    #  ldap = Net::LDAP.new
    #  ldap.host = your_server_ip_address
    #  ldap.port = 389
    #  ldap.auth your_user_name, your_user_password
    #  if ldap.bind
    #    # authentication succeeded
    #  else
    #    # authentication failed
    #    p ldap.get_operation_result
    #  end
    #
    # You don't have to create a new instance of Net::LDAP every time
    # you perform a binding in this way. If you prefer, you can cache the Net::LDAP object
    # and re-use it to perform subsequent bindings, <i>provided</i> you call
    # #auth to specify a new credential before calling #bind. Otherwise, you'll
    # just re-authenticate the previous user! (You don't need to re-set
    # the values of #host and #port.) As noted in the documentation for #auth,
    # the password parameter can be a Ruby Proc instead of a String.
    #
    #--
    # If there is an @open_connection, then perform the bind
    # on it. Otherwise, connect, bind, and disconnect.
    # The latter operation is obviously useful only as an auth check.
    #
    def bind auth=@auth
      if @open_connection
        @result = @open_connection.bind auth
      else
        conn = Connection.new( :host => @host, :port => @port , :encryption => @encryption)
        @result = conn.bind @auth
        conn.close
      end

      @result == 0
    end

    #
    # #bind_as is for testing authentication credentials.
    #
    # As described under #bind, most LDAP servers require that you supply a complete DN
    # as a binding-credential, along with an authenticator such as a password.
    # But for many applications (such as authenticating users to a Rails application),
    # you often don't have a full DN to identify the user. You usually get a simple
    # identifier like a username or an email address, along with a password.
    # #bind_as allows you to authenticate these user-identifiers.
    #
    # #bind_as is a combination of a search and an LDAP binding. First, it connects and
    # binds to the directory as normal. Then it searches the directory for an entry
    # corresponding to the email address, username, or other string that you supply.
    # If the entry exists, then #bind_as will <b>re-bind</b> as that user with the
    # password (or other authenticator) that you supply.
    #
    # #bind_as takes the same parameters as #search, <i>with the addition of an
    # authenticator.</i> Currently, this authenticator must be <tt>:password</tt>.
    # Its value may be either a String, or a +proc+ that returns a String.
    # #bind_as returns +false+ on failure. On success, it returns a result set,
    # just as #search does. This result set is an Array of objects of
    # type Net::LDAP::Entry. It contains the directory attributes corresponding to
    # the user. (Just test whether the return value is logically true, if you don't
    # need this additional information.)
    #
    # Here's how you would use #bind_as to authenticate an email address and password:
    #
    #  require 'net/ldap'
    #
    #  user,psw = "joe_user@yourcompany.com", "joes_psw"
    #
    #  ldap = Net::LDAP.new
    #  ldap.host = "192.168.0.100"
    #  ldap.port = 389
    #  ldap.auth "cn=manager,dc=yourcompany,dc=com", "topsecret"
    #
    #  result = ldap.bind_as(
    #    :base => "dc=yourcompany,dc=com",
    #    :filter => "(mail=#{user})",
    #    :password => psw
    #  )
    #  if result
    #    puts "Authenticated #{result.first.dn}"
    #  else
    #    puts "Authentication FAILED."
    #  end
    def bind_as args={}
      result = false
      open {|me|
        rs = search args
        if rs and rs.first and dn = rs.first.dn
          password = args[:password]
          password = password.call if password.respond_to?(:call)
          result = rs if bind :method => :simple, :username => dn, :password => password
        end
      }
      result
    end


    # Adds a new entry to the remote LDAP server.
    # Supported arguments:
    # :dn :: Full DN of the new entry
    # :attributes :: Attributes of the new entry.
    #
    # The attributes argument is supplied as a Hash keyed by Strings or Symbols
    # giving the attribute name, and mapping to Strings or Arrays of Strings
    # giving the actual attribute values. Observe that most LDAP directories
    # enforce schema constraints on the attributes contained in entries.

        if (@result = conn.bind( args[:auth] || @auth )) == 0
          @result = conn.add( args )

    # Modifies the attribute values of a particular entry on the LDAP directory.
    # Takes a hash with arguments. Supported arguments are:
    # :dn :: (the full DN of the entry whose attributes are to be modified)
    # :operations :: (the modifications to be performed, detailed next)
    #
    # This method returns True or False to indicate whether the operation
    # succeeded or failed, with extended information available by calling
    # #get_operation_result.
    #
    # Also see #add_attribute, #replace_attribute, or #delete_attribute, which
    # provide simpler interfaces to this functionality.
    #
    # The LDAP protocol provides a full and well thought-out set of operations
    # for changing the values of attributes, but they are necessarily somewhat complex
    # and not always intuitive. If these instructions are confusing or incomplete,
    # please send us email or create a bug report on rubyforge.
    #
    # The :operations parameter to #modify takes an array of operation-descriptors.
    # Each individual operation is specified in one element of the array, and
    # most LDAP servers will attempt to perform the operations in order.
    #
    # Each of the operations appearing in the Array must itself be an Array
    # with exactly three elements:
    # an operator:: must be :add, :replace, or :delete
    # an attribute name:: the attribute name (string or symbol) to modify
    # a value:: either a string or an array of strings.
    #
    # The :add operator will, unsurprisingly, add the specified values to
    # the specified attribute. If the attribute does not already exist,
    # :add will create it. Most LDAP servers will generate an error if you
    # try to add a value that already exists.
    #
    # :replace will erase the current value(s) for the specified attribute,
    # if there are any, and replace them with the specified value(s).
    #
    # :delete will remove the specified value(s) from the specified attribute.
    # If you pass nil, an empty string, or an empty array as the value parameter
    # to a :delete operation, the _entire_ _attribute_ will be deleted, along
    # with all of its values.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #  dn = "mail=modifyme@example.com,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com"
    #  ops = [
    #    [:add, :mail, "aliasaddress@example.com"],
    #    [:replace, :mail, ["newaddress@example.com", "newalias@example.com"]],
    #    [:delete, :sn, nil]
    #  ]
    #  ldap.modify :dn => dn, :operations => ops
    #
    # <i>(This example is contrived since you probably wouldn't add a mail
    # value right before replacing the whole attribute, but it shows that order
    # of execution matters. Also, many LDAP servers won't let you delete SN
    # because that would be a schema violation.)</i>
    #
    # It's essential to keep in mind that if you specify more than one operation in
    # a call to #modify, most LDAP servers will attempt to perform all of the operations
    # in the order you gave them.
    # This matters because you may specify operations on the
    # same attribute which must be performed in a certain order.
    #
    # Most LDAP servers will _stop_ processing your modifications if one of them
    # causes an error on the server (such as a schema-constraint violation).
    # If this happens, you will probably get a result code from the server that
    # reflects only the operation that failed, and you may or may not get extended
    # information that will tell you which one failed. #modify has no notion
    # of an atomic transaction. If you specify a chain of modifications in one
    # call to #modify, and one of them fails, the preceding ones will usually
    # not be "rolled back," resulting in a partial update. This is a limitation
    # of the LDAP protocol, not of Net::LDAP.
    #
    # The lack of transactional atomicity in LDAP means that you're usually
    # better off using the convenience methods #add_attribute, #replace_attribute,
    # and #delete_attribute, which are are wrappers over #modify. However, certain
    # LDAP servers may provide concurrency semantics, in which the several operations
    # contained in a single #modify call are not interleaved with other
    # modification-requests received simultaneously by the server.
    # It bears repeating that this concurrency does _not_ imply transactional
    # atomicity, which LDAP does not provide.

    # 02May06: Well, I added support for RFC-2696-style paged searches.
    # This is used on all queries because the extension is marked non-critical.
    # As far as I know, only A/D uses this, but it's required for A/D. Otherwise
    # you won't get more than 1000 results back from a query.
    # This implementation is kindof clunky and should probably be refactored.
    # Also, is it my imagination, or are A/Ds the slowest directory servers ever???
